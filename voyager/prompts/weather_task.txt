Your task is to interact with a weather API to gather weather information of several cities.
The cities for this task are Palo Alto, Seoul, and Paris.
You'll need to choose an API, send relevant requests, parse the JSON responses, extract relevant information, and store these pieces of information in a CSV file.
Each city's data should be on a separate line with the city's name, temperature, humidity, and weather condition as the column values.
