# Goal
Interact with Weather API to get data on 3 cities and save them to a CSV file.

# Potential tasks
> [1] API Setup
Research the chosen Weather API for how to interact with it (e.g. API endpoints, request parameters, headers, response format).
Register and get API key if necessary.

> [2] API Interaction
Write a function to construct the API request for a specific city.
Write a function to call the Weather API and parse the response to extract the necessary data. This function will use the request function from the previous step.

> [3] Gather data and write to CSV
Use the API interaction function to get weather data for each of the three cities.
Save to CSV.

# Notes
- May need to ask user for API key, can either interact with user or use keyless API
